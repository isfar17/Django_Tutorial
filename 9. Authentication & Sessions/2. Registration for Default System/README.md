here most of the work is automatically done by django. login to logout everything.

for this project we are using :

username:jubayer
password: NewPass123

here are the  Choices of default user registration/login attributes of django: 

date_joined, email, first_name, groups, id, is_active, is_staff, is_superuser, last_login, last_name, logentry, password, 
user_permissions, username

these are the pre defined attributes we can access/user from the models or to use when logging in/registration.
