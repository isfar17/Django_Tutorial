Dynamic url means a url that interacts with user. There are two terms we need to understand. Static and Dynamic. So static means non-
interactive. It means if any url is static, we can only use it to go to any page or any link. But when we say Dynamic, it brings more.
Dynamic means interactive. So with a dynamic url, we can pass our own data and it can be processed from backend. This is dynamic.
for example: we can sum two numbers by passing them in urls. We can see different information on webpage by passing data in url.

1. Write 2 functions one is static another is dynamic with a parameter
2. make a urls.py in first_App and route the urls there
3. Go to project.urls and connect it with include()
4. run the server and test
