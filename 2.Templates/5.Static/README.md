adding static file is easy.

1. go and setup templates and other stuffs.
2. Base url for static files is set to static. so we make a folder named static.
3. unlike templates, to avoid name confusion,we make subfolder for the app itself
4. make image folder and store an image
5. go to templates and first of all load static
6. then set the static url and we are good to go
